  "description": "This library leverages a \"target\" property to smartly correlate diverse datasetsâ€”whether you're merging multi-timeframe arrays of stock prices, crypto trends, ETF indexes, or even weather reports. It precomputes timestamps and breaks large datasets into smaller chunks, then uses an efficient two-pointer approach to align entries across different intervals (like 1d, 1h, 5m, etc.) seamlessly. The result is a unified, time-synchronized dataset that makes it easy to analyze trends and correlations, helping you turn raw data into actionable insights quickly and effectively.",
